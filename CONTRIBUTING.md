# Contributing guide

Welcome to the [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) community! Contributions to the SwiftNIO QUIC project are welcomed and encouraged. 

We welcome developers from all backgrounds and experience levels. A diverse and friendly community has more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produces better software.

## How you can help

- Reporting bugs with clear, reproducible steps as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-quic/issues)
- Improving documentation to make the project more accessible
- Adding or enhancing tests to improve reliability and coverage
- Proposing and implementing enhancements
- Participating in the [Networking](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/networking/129) or [Server](https://forums.swift.org/c/server/43) topics on the Swift Forums

## Setting up your environment

See the Getting Started section of the README for prerequisites and build instructions.

## Issues and bugs

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or provide feedback. Please submit an Issue before doing time-consuming or complex work to get acknowledgement from the maintainers.

Specify the following:

* SwiftNIO QUIC version
* Contextual information (e.g. what you were trying to achieve with
  swift-nio-quic)
* Simplest possible steps to reproduce
  * The more complex the steps are, the lower the priority will be.
  * A pull request with failing test case is preferred, but it's just fine to
    paste the test case into the issue description.
* Anything that might be relevant in your opinion, such as:
  * Swift version or the output of `swift --version`
  * OS version and the output of `uname -a`
  * Network configuration

### Example

## Submitting pull requests 

A good SwiftNIO QUIC pull request is:

1. Concise, and contains as few changes as needed to achieve the end result.
2. Tested, ensuring that any tests provided failed before the patch and pass
   after it.
3. Documented, adding API documentation as needed to cover new functions and
   properties.
4. Accompanied by a great commit message

### Tests and running CI
Thorough testing is required for all contributions and all checks must pass before merging. 

Local Testing: Before submission, ensure all changes pass local tests:
```
swift test
```

Automated Tests: New features and bug fixes require corresponding automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) that validate the intended behavior and prevent regressions. You are responsible for verifying the correctness and coverage of all tests.
